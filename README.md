<h3>About me</h3>
 
Hi I'm Joshua, a Junior majoring in Information Technology and New Jersey Institute of Technology. I have a long history with technology and now more recently coding. I've been very interested in the latest technological advancements for as long as I can remember. But more recently I have found a new passion for coding. I was first introduced to the world of coding with Python, at first I found it to be very difficult and tedious, but the more I practiced the more I began to love the problem solving aspect of coding. From there I moved to Java, where I thought that this would be where I would give up. I have never even heard of "object oriented programming" but yet I was still very much drawn to it and its requirement to push myself beyond what I have become used to with Python. Learning to code is like learning how to rewire your brian to think like a computer. Which is what I did.
 
From there I moved over to the world of web applications, taking my newly rewired brain to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is where I found my passion. Coding was no longer a daunting task for me. But rather a challenge I looked forward to facing.
 
I am currently just about one year away from graduating with a BS in Information Technology and jumping into the deep end of the development world.
 
Which brings us to why I've made this website. First and foremost, because I found so much satisfaction and joy in making this interactive resume. But secondly, to show that I am capable of creating such a masterpiece in my very young and early career.
 
<h3>This website consists of 58.0% HTML, 34.5% CSS, and 7.5% JavaScript.</h3>
This will most definitely change as I make more improvements to the website over time as my career grows and my skills mature. But I have shown that I am capable of jumping into the deep end and will continue to do so as my career goes on.
