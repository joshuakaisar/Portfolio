<h3>About me</h3>
 
Hi, I'm Joshua, a Junior at New Jersey Institute of Technology majoring in Information Technology. I have a long history with technology and now more recently coding. I've been very interested in the latest technological advancements for as long as I can remember. More recently I have a new found passion for coding. First introduced to the world of coding with Python, I found it to be very difficult and tedious, however, the more I practiced the more I grew to love the problem solving aspect of coding. From Python, I moved to Java. I thought that this would be where I would give up. I had never heard of "object oriented programming," but yet I was still very much drawn to it and its requirement to push beyond what I had become used to with Python. Learning to code is like learning how to rewire your brian to think like a computer. Which is what I did.
 
I pushed forward towards the world of web applications, taking my newly rewired brain to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is where I found my passion. Coding was no longer a daunting task for me, rather a challenge I looked forward to facing.
 
I am currently just about one year away from graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and jumping into the deep end of the development world.
 
This brings us to why I've made this website. First and foremost, I found so much satisfaction and joy in making this interactive resume. Secondly, I want to show that I am capable of creating such a masterpiece in my very young and early career.
 
<h3>This website consists of 58.0% HTML, 34.5% CSS, and 7.5% JavaScript.</h3>

This will most definitely change as I make more improvements to the website over time as my career grows and my skills mature. But I have shown that I am capable of jumping into the deep end and will continue to do so as my career goes on.
